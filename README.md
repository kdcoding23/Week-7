Promineo Tech's Week 7 assignment was to use basic HTML to create a website that has:

- At least 3 pages with links to navigate between all pages present on each page.
- 2 different size headers, list, 3 images, table, and a form.

I created a site that lists my favorite movies and TV shows (using an unordered list) and recently read books (using a table).
